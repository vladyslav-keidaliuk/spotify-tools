# spotify-tools


Maybe someone like me wants to make a public playlist from a "favorite" playlist,
but alas it is impossible in the application,
so I created a function "copy_favorite_tracks_to_public_playlist".

Currently, there are the following features:

- creating a public playlist from a favourite


- creation of N public playlists, each with 100 tracks,
for convenient downloading via third-party services (e.g. https://spotify-downloader.com/),
this is not an advertisement.


- The function that remove the prefix of the service https://spotify-downloader.com/,
which it adds to each track and accordingly the search by name disappears.


- The function that export titles of tracks from public playlist to .txt file 
with sorting by alphabet or not (as you want)
